#Introduction

The project "Enrollment System for Freshmen" is a final project for the first semester of my journey
as a first year student at PHINMA University of Pangasinan. Therefore, this project is not a work
by a professional (but soon to be a professional) and this means this might contain bugs (if there's
any) or things wont work as you expected.

I as the main developer of the group, will continue to update this project whenever I can

#Project Overview

We came up with this idea because we all know that finals are coming up for freshmen students and after
finals, it is the start of second semester. But what comes first before second semester? Enrollment.
And we would like our project to be somewhat related to school.

#Project Features

	ENROLL
	The main part of the system. The user can input here the information’s needed such as the name, age,
  what course, etc. from the students.

	REMOVE
	In case that there’s a student that needs to be removed or mistakenly added, we also added this feature.
  In this feature, the program will automatically display the list of enrolled students and type the full
  name of the student that will be removed.

	MAKE SOME CHANGES TO A STUDENT INFO 
	If there’s a mistake in encoding the information of the student, the encoder can use this feature to access
  a student’s info and change the needed information.

	VIEW ENROLLED STUDENTS
		The encoder can use this feature If the encoder wants to:
•	See his/her progress
•	How many students did he/she enrolled
•	If he/she already encoded the student

	DONE ENROLLING 
	If the encoder wants to end the session, then he/she can use this feature. After confirming to end the session,
  the program will ask the user what will be the file name then it will export to a .txt file. If the file already
  exists the encoder will be asked if the program will overwrite the file or type another different file name.

There are more features that might be added to the system for future updates.
