Hi to everyone whose reading this. First of all I would like to say about this file.

This is a final project for the First Semester

This is not a work of professionals but it is a work of a group of students. Which means
this project might contains bugs (if there's any) or things wont work as you expected.

Not sure but if there's time I would update the file for new features.

That's all. Hope you like it! Happy Coding.
